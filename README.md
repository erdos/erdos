Hi, this is the personal account of *János Erdős* _(air-doe-sh)_, a software engineer based in Budapest. Here I share open-source projects on topics that fascinate me: functional programming, data structures, geometry, etc.

If you have any questions or feedback, free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/erdosjr). You can also check my [blog posts](https://erdos.dev) for more insights. Here I want to highlight the following projects:

- [Stencil](https://github.com/erdos/stencil), the OOXML templating engine written in Clojure
- Small language syntax tools, such as an implementation of [Power Assertions](https://github.com/erdos/erdos.assert) and [lazy generators](https://github.com/erdos/erdos.yield)
- Some more advanced tools, such as an [experimental native Clojure REPL](https://github.com/erdos/uclj) and a [Java disassembler](https://github.com/erdos/class-analyzer)
- The latest [Advent of Code solutions](https://github.com/erdos/advent-of-code)
- Fun side projects, such as a [spherical geometry sandbox](https://github.com/erdos/sphere), a [command-line Sankey diagram tool](https://github.com/erdos/riall), a naive [equality saturation](https://github.com/erdos/cogent) program.
